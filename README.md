# Detectron Car Dent Segmentation Project

This project demonstrates how to use Detectron2, a powerful object detection and segmentation framework, to segment the dents in a car.

## Introduction

Car dents can be a common occurrence, but they can be difficult to detect and fix without the proper tools. In this project, we aim to use Detectron2 to segment the dents in a car and create a mask around the affected area. This can help to make the dent repair process easier and more efficient.

## Installation

This project was developed using Google Colab, which provides a Jupyter Notebook-like interface with access to powerful cloud-based computing resources. To run this project, you will need to create a new Colab notebook and upload the `detectron_car_dent_segmentation.ipynb` file.

You will also need to install the following dependencies:

- `detectron2`: The core segmentation library used in this project.
- `torch`: PyTorch is a deep learning library used to train the models.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library used to visualize the results.


Here are some example results from the project:

## Conclusion

Using Detectron2, we were able to successfully segment the dents in a car and create a mask around the affected area. This can help to make the dent repair process easier and more efficient. With further development, this project could be expanded to include additional types of car damage and be used in real-world applications.
